# Functional JS
 Reactive Extensions [Rx] Library for Javascript
 
 
 This is a series of interactive exercises for learning Microsoft's Reactive Extensions (Rx) Library for Javascript. So why is the title "Functional Programming in Javascript"? Well it turns out that the key to learning Rx is training yourself to use functional programming to manipulate collections. Functional programming provides developers with the tools to abstract common collection operations into reusable, composable building blocks. You'll be surprised to learn that most of the operations you perform on collections can be accomplished with five simple functions (some native to JavaScript and some included in the RxJS library):

    map
    filter
    concatAll
    reduce
    zip
